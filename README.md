# **TileTinker: Sprite Sheet Cutter**

TileTinker is a web-based tool for game developers and pixel artists to cut sprite sheets into individual tiles. It allows users to upload a sprite sheet, define the number of rows and columns, preview the grid layout with numbered tiles, and download all the slices as a ZIP file.

## **Features**

- **Upload Sprite Sheets**: Supports common image formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG).
- **Customizable Grid**: Set the number of rows and columns to define the tile layout.
- **Live Preview**: Displays a grid overlay on the sprite sheet, dynamically numbered for easy reference.
- **Downloadable Slices**: Packages all slices into a single ZIP file for download.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js (version 16+)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
